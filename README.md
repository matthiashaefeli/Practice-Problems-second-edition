# Practice-Problems-second-edition

Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.

Example

For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3.

Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7.

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (rb)
[input] array.integer statues

An array of distinct non-negative integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ statues.length ≤ 10,
0 ≤ statues[i] ≤ 20.

[output] integer

The minimal number of statues that need to be added to existing statues such that it contains every integer size from an interval [L, R](for some L, R) and no other sizes.

Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (rb)
[input] array.integer sequence

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 105,
-105 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 105.

[output] boolean

Return true if it is possible to remove one element from the array in order to get a strictly increasing sequence, otherwise return false.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get the Middle Character

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sum of Pairs

Given a list of integers and a single sum value, return the first two values (parse from the left please) in order of appearance that add up to form the sum.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
auto_complete

The autocomplete function will take in an input string and a dictionary array and return the values from the dictionary that start with the input string. If there are more than 5 matches, restrict your output to the first 5 results. If there are no matches, return an empty array.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Counting_duplicates

Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphanumeric characters, including digits, uppercase and lowercase alphabets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reverse_alphabetic_characters

Given a string str, reverse it omitting all non-alphabetic characters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

binary_array_to_number

Given an array of one's and zero's convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1
Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

square_digits


Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

encode

a = 1 b = 2 etc is the alphabet
give a string and a key
method should return the number of the letter with the key
 s  c  o  u  t
19  3 15 21 20
key equal to 1939
output should be [20, 12, 18, 30, 21]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


persistence

Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
persistence(999) # returns 4, because 9*9*9=729, 7*2*9=126,
                  # 1*2*6=12, and finally 1*2=2


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

find_longest

Find the number with the most digits.
If two numbers in the argument array have the same number of digits, return the first one in the array.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mean

You will be given an array which will include both integers and characters.

Return an array of length 2 with a[0] representing the mean of the ten integers as a floating point number. There will always be 10 integers and 10 characters. Create a single string with the characters and return it as a[1] while maintaining the original order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

group

Given an array of numbers, your function should return an array of arrays, where each subarray contains all the duplicates of a particular number. Subarrays should be in the same order as the first occurence of the number they contain:
group([3, 2, 6, 2, 1, 3])
>>> [[3, 3], [2, 2], [6], [1]]

delete_nth

Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took many pictures of the places they've been, and now they want to show Charlie their entire collection. However, Charlie doesn't like this sessions, since the motive usually repeats. He isn't fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times. He tells them that he will only sit during the session if they show the same motive at most N times. Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the motive as a number. Can you help them to remove numbers such that their list contains each number only up to N times, without changing the order?
